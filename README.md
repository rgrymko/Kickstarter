# Kickstarting with Excel

Title: Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project and Purpose
The goal of this project is to: 
help Louise with her Kickstarter project campaign. And the deliverables for Louise are:Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart, Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart, and Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md).

Then we'll make the data more readable and searchable with the help of Excel tools.We'll be performing data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends. To do this, we'll need to get acquainted with Excel a bit more. Specifically, we need to know how to view and read data in an Excel file. Let's discuss some of the visual features of Excel. Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

The bottom line is: The number of successful Theater/Musical productions were 60, The number of successful Theater/Plays productions was 694, and the number of successful Theater/spaces productions was 85 from chart#1 Parent Category Outcomes. The bottom line for Outcomes based on launch date from Chart #3 are as follows: 
There were a total of 9 successful live productions ( 1 in January, 2 in February, and 6 in March). The sum of the total successful productions: were a total of 412 successful productions throught the year (27 in January, 35 in February, 26 in March, 28 in Arpril, 53 successful in May, 48 in June, 44 in July, 42 in August, 32 in September, 35 in October, 25 in November, and 17 in December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The bottom line outcomes based on goals from chart #2: The number of successful productions is in orange color, the goal is in dark blue color, the total projects is in royal blue color, Percentage successul is in green color. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had a lot of challenges and difficulties creating pivot tables and box and whisker plots.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Live productions were only successful in January, February and March. The productions were most successful in May.
- 
-What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
When the goal was between 1000 to 4999, the percentage of successful productions was the majority or highest at 73.09%. When the goal was less than 1000 the percentage successul was the lowest at 1.54%.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It is harder to understand the dataset in plots than in tables. The dataset does not have clear units of measure.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible table is Outcomes based on goals
A possible graph was that puts all the productions in categories.
